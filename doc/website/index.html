    <p>SpindleCAD is a research project which aims to help engineers
    design machine tool spindles.</p>
    <p>The distinguishing feature of project that it is not only
    allows to check properties of finished construction but also
    optimize construction itself with respect to precision and
    productivity. In other words engineer enters desirable spindle
    parameters (power output, precision, rotation speed, approximate
    spindle shape) and gets construction which optimally meets his
    needs.</p>
    <div class="date">Motivation</div>
    Near all popular CAD systems
    include tools which helps in shaft design. These tools allow us to
    create shaft drawings or 3D models with fixed user specified
    form. There is no widespread system that perform shaft
    construction optimization especially with respect to machine tool
    spindle requirements. We need to create such instrument.
    <div class="date">Goal</div>
    Engineer describes <em>approximate
    shape</em> (sketch) of the spindle, various technical and
    functional <em>constraints</em> (dimensions range, precision,
    bearing types, bearing life, rotation speed, lubricant type, power
    output, loads, etc.) and also describes <em>optimization
    goals</em> (minimum weight, minimum bearings count, etc.). Then
    the program searches for optimal parameters combination that is
    &ldquo;best fit&rdquo; to stated goals.
    <p>Its planned to perform:<br>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>dimension optimization (diameters and lengths of shaft sections, inter-bearing distance)</li>
      <li>topology optimization (what kind, where and how many bearings to use) </li>
      <li>precision optimization (calculation of minimal necessary precision requirements for spindle parts from precision requirements for machine tool)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>It is necessary to pay attention, that the check of given technical and functional constraints will be carried out not only during optimization, but also during creation and edition of the  unit sketch. Thus we can perform check of ready constructions or the sketch itself directly during work.</p>
