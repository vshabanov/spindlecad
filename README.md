Old (2006-08) experiments with modelling and optimising machine tool spindles.

Imported from SourceForge (https://spindlecad.sourceforge.net/, https://sourceforge.net/projects/spindlecad/)

It was a research part of my mechanical engineering diploma. I confirmed my supervisor's idea that it's possible to make a spindle with less runout (eccentricity) than that of its bearings by installing the bearings at certain angles (precision bearings have their runout measured and mark the location of the maximum deviation).

I played with finite elements, computer algebra system ([Maxima](https://maxima.sourceforge.io/)), type-level physical numbers.
